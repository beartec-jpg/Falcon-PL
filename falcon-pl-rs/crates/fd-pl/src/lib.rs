//! # Falcon PL (FPL) — Participation Ledger
//!
//! Product **Falcon PL**, ticker **FPL**, consensus **Falcon Consensus**,
//! signatures **Falcon-512** (or HMAC-dev for harnesses).
//!
//! - Ordered ledgers of signed txs (not a DAG; not an XRPL fork)
//! - Bonded participants join the **packer lottery** (ranked #1, #2, …)
//! - Lottery seed is **deterministic from tip + bonded set + certified skips**
//!   (not per-node pong views — multi-host safety, v2.3.0 P0)
//! - **v2.5.0:** lottery ONLINE inputs are **frozen at tip commit** for the open height
//!   (ONLINE cert mid-height must not re-elect the packer)
//! - **v2.6.0:** open-height **liveness** — poison-only future-seq drop (keep sequential
//!   pipeline), skip offline/lagging active seats, view-change when height stalls
//!   (poison / unavailable / silent packer), reopen when all lottery seats are skip-QC'd
//! - **v2.7.0:** public-safety surface — registry-only keys, signed votes, mesh
//!   admin-wire lock + unix operator socket, tip-committed QC, integer lottery,
//!   Hello product/network handshake, hmac-dev refused without `--allow-dev-crypto`
//! - **v2.7.1:** catch-up cannot rewind a live tip (operator-only genesis wipe)
//! - **v2.7.2:** one apply path — state/root uses ledger `sealed_at_ms`; `tick` is
//!   timeouts only; genesis h=1 waits for live seats
//! - **v2.7.3:** one body per height (no skip/pack race); dual proposals converge
//!   on lower hash; n≥6 soft QC is majority; view-change clears the open height
//! - **v2.7.4:** lottery freezes a committee of 6 (1 packer + 5 checkers).
//! - **v2.7.5:** soft was 3 of 5 checkers (superseded by 2.9.0 4-of-6).
//!   Hard still `ceil(n×0.6)` over all bonded. Skip walks the same 6.
//! - **v2.7.6:** view-change **redraws** the committee (dead packer cannot pin
//!   the height). Same packer cannot reseal after VC. Lagging catch-up adopts
//!   the peer body over a local uncommitted dual.
//! - **v2.8.0:** mesh gossips **headers only**; bodies are pull-once. Light vals
//!   keep a short body window. Keyring is self-SK + registry PKs. Outbound
//!   queues are **byte-capped**.
//! - **v2.8.1:** lottery is **f(committed tip)** only — bonded set + view.
//!   ONLINE/pong is pack permission, never a seed input. Same tip ⇒ same 6.
//! - **v2.9.0:** tip advances on **4-of-6 committee QC**. Cert rides the next
//!   header. Checker double-OK is slashed. Skip/VC use the same 4-of-6 bar.
//! - **v2.9.1:** archive bodies live on **disk**, not RSS. RAM always strips
//!   after `max_body_ledgers`. Snapshots are compact JSON. Pack dry-run does
//!   not clone the KeyRing. Inbound fan is byte-capped.
//! - **v2.9.2:** lottery is **f(committed tip)** only. View-change does not
//!   reseed or redraw the 6. Same tip ⇒ same committee after restart.
//! - **v2.9.3:** a discarded pending is not a commit. After the 6 are all
//!   skip-QC'd on an **uncommitted** height, reopen the attempt: clear skips
//!   **and** sealer bans. Never burn the committee on a height with no tip.
//! - **v2.9.4:** never discard a **unique** pending body. View-change is for
//!   silence or dual hashes. One attempt body until commit or full-committee
//!   reopen. Re-fan that hash; do not mint a fatter second body.
//! - **v2.9.5:** `sealed_at` is **chain time**. Pack and ingest bound it by
//!   the parent ledger, not local snap `now_ms`. Power-cut clock skew cannot
//!   reject an honest pack.
//! - **v2.9.6:** pack folds settle/unbond and computes the state root at the
//!   same `pack_sealed_at()` stamp written on the header. Local `now_ms` is
//!   timeouts only (2.7.2). A drifted snap clock cannot self-reject 1929.
//! - **v2.9.7:** uncommitted OK votes are attempt-local. Snap load drops
//!   `ok_by_height_voter` / slashes for `h > tip` (pending body is not
//!   restored). Reopen clears them. Else a 2.9.5 ghost vote pins 1929.
//! - **v2.9.8:** packer feed is hub inventory. NeedTxs / hub push send
//!   **applicable heads first**. Winner re-pulls while `!applicable`.
//!   Pull budget is a real RTT (not 150ms). Progress-skip waits out that
//!   budget (P1/P6). Observer mempool is not proof the winner is silent.
//! - **v2.9.9:** progress-skip is **offline/lag only**. After hub feed, every
//!   observer has applicable txs; skip-QC of a live winner burned the 6
//!   (7880 storm). Live silence → view-change, not 3s skip.
//! - **v2.9.10:** committed tip without a stored 4-of-6 cert (snap/catch-up)
//!   re-collects committee OKs. Pack must not wait forever on `certs[tip]`.
//! - **v2.9.11:** live winner with **no proposal** after pack+pull budget is
//!   skipped (not 12s VC). Budget = pack_budget + NeedTxs grace + 1.5s —
//!   never a raw 2s (that is shorter than grace+pack). Observer inventory
//!   alone is still not a skip (2.9.9). Poison stays VC.
//! - **v2.9.12:** skip QC uses **hub inventory ads**, not the voter's mempool.
//!   Light checkers see hub `mempool_len` on Pong. 4-of-6 can form when only
//!   hubs hold the backlog. Idle (no hub pending) still does not skip.
//! - **v2.9.13:** committee body push. Header-only + reply-to-forwarder left
//!   remotes 14s behind on fat pending (NeedLedgerBody hit a peer with no
//!   body). Packer/hubs push `LedgerBody` on the tx plane; checkers retry pull.
//! - **v2.9.14:** skip = unavailable only (pong stale / tip behind). A seen
//!   header is already a proposal. Hubs dish one ledger to **winner + first
//!   backup** at tip commit so a height gaps only if both fail to seal.
//! - **v2.9.15:** designated lanes. Header/OK on cons; `LedgerBody` to the
//!   **QC committee only** on a reserved body lane; dish/submit on inventory.
//!   Mainnet assumes remotes — same-host 4-of-6 is luck, not a design.
//! - **v2.9.16:** catch-up lane. `NeedLedgers` no longer shares the cons
//!   pipe with votes (v3 dropped pulls under soak). Join/residual has its
//!   own queue; prefer hubs.
//! - **v2.9.17:** after snap start, do not pack until a peer tip is heard
//!   (or 12s grace). Staggered resume forked droplet (16984 vs 16993).
//! - **v2.9.18:** epoch settle is f(committed work), not the RAM body window.
//!   Joiners that kept extra bodies (copied archive snap, no store) diverged
//!   at the first epoch boundary (20922).
//! - **v2.9.19:** pre-upgrade epoch-boundary ledgers still verify. 2.9.17
//!   packed 34799 with the 64-body walk; 2.9.18 incremental rejected it.
//!   The trigger ledger's `fee_total` selects the formula (0 → old walk).
//! - **v2.9.20:** catch-up is one inflight pull to one hub; a batch is
//!   contiguous and byte-capped so a Falcon-512 ledger fits the lane.
//!   **2.9.42 hotfix (AMD-20260827-1):** that hub rotates after an empty
//!   residual / inflight miss, and skips a peer whose advertised tip is
//!   not ahead of us (first-hub pin to a dead/old version froze v1).
//! - **v2.9.21:** archive hubs **serve snapshots**. A joiner more than
//!   `SNAPSHOT_PULL_LAG` (256) behind pulls a snap, then residual NeedLedgers.
//!   History nodes exist so joiners do not scp a file.
//! - **v2.9.22:** pin the served snap file; never ask a non-archive; do
//!   not restart a transfer because the archive saved again (60s rotate
//!   aborted 932-chunk pulls with `snap hash changed`).
//! - **v2.9.23:** join snap is tip state + 128 ledgers (~MB), not the 20k
//!   tail (160 MB). Chunk pull retries the current index. NeedLedgers is
//!   not starved if the snap transfer stalls.
//! - **v2.9.24:** archive **pushes** the join snap (Offer + every chunk)
//!   on `NeedSnapshot`. A pull is exclusive — no `NeedLedgers` on that
//!   TCP until adopt or abort. Out-of-order assembler + pipelined hole
//!   fill. Stall aborts and re-asks for a snap, not a 64-ledger residual.
//! - **v2.9.25:** `take_catchup_pull` is silent while `wants_snapshot`.
//!   2.9.24 only blocked residual after the Offer created an assembler;
//!   before that the ticker still sent NeedLedgers and v11 never saw the
//!   Offer under soak. v4 adopted 834 ledgers in 6s once the Offer landed.
//! - **v2.9.26:** rotate the served join pin when live tip is
//!   `SNAPSHOT_PULL_LAG` ahead, even if joiners are still downloading the
//!   old sha. Idle-only rotate let NeedSnapshot keep the pin hot forever.
//! - **v2.9.27:** snap is **join / disaster only** (tip=0 or lag ≥ 2048).
//!   In-mesh residual of a certified ledger applies state without re-verifying
//!   every Falcon tx. Live pack still verifies. Archive ads survive adopt.
//!   Validators follow live gossip; they are not fed a new tip every 256.
//! - **v2.9.34:** archive `--max-chain-ledgers 0` is **20 000**, not 1
//!   (the `.max(1)` clamp dropped every header after tip). Disk bodies
//!   are indexed by height so `NeedLedgers` can serve a 2-high gap after
//!   a rolling restart. Empty residual (3×) pulls a join snap. Pack waits
//!   for 4 seats on tip so a bounce cannot seal ahead of the QC set.
//!   **2.9.42 hotfix:** a lagging **archive** also join-snaps after 3×
//!   empty residual (it used to never pull, only serve).
//! - **v2.9.43:** empty BitVM2 rail fields omitted from serde (same
//!   pattern as `last_real_bits`). New-binary joiner + pre-bitvm2 snap
//!   was hashing `bitvm2_claims:{}` into the commitment root.
//! - **v2.9.37:** BTC NUMS P2TR pool + script-path BitVM Kickoff (no FROST
//!   on that address). Dest owner signs. SHA256-step disprove. Live FROST
//!   UTXO is unchanged until an operator migrates it.
//! - **v2.9.38:** `BtcPoolMove` — last FROST key-path spend of the pool into
//!   the NUMS P2TR. Packed `vault_pub` becomes NUMS. Kickoff after this is
//!   dest-signed script-path.
//! - **v2.9.39:** ETH/USDC-in is a Sepolia sync-committee light client +
//!   execution receipt MPT. Watchers relay; they cannot mint.
//! - **v2.9.42:** NUMS internal key is even-Y (BIP341-spendable). Kickoff is
//!   dest+watch. Odd-Y v1 pool address cannot be spent; book retargets.
//! - **v2.9.41:** BTC Kickoff tapleaf is dest CHECKSIG + committed watcher
//!   CHECKSIGVERIFY. NUMS key-path still dead. Migrates v1 anyone-CHECKSIG UTXO.
//! - **v2.9.40:** LC finality_update + receipt-trie key = RLP(index) +
//!   execution-header walk to LC head. Auto-mint uses that path.
//! - **v2.9.28:** separate seat binaries (`falcon-pl-archive` / `-hub` / `-val`).
//! - **v2.9.29:** `TxBody::WatcherHeartbeat` — fee + current slot, zero work.
//! - **v2.9.30:** WatcherCredit disabled; CreditAsset native mint admin-only.
//!   Val role hard-caps the RAM chain at 128. Same crate, different process.
//! - **v2.9.47:** restore `drop_slashes_that_break_quorum` on pack (hotfix2);
//!   round-mode sealed-body no longer bans a late-cached packer from sealing
//!   when its round arrives; historical `jailed && jail_count==0` Unjail costs
//!   `2× min_bond` and persists count=1. Enables safe Phase 2 re-enable.
//! - **v2.9.48:** Phase 2 **pause window** `[vote_rounds_pause_from,
//!   vote_rounds_resume_at)`: heights inside use legacy `pl-ok:v1`, round-scoped
//!   rules apply on both sides. 2300 bakes `[371037, 375000)` (the legacy-signed
//!   certs from the 2026-10-05 pause onward), so re-enabling Phase 2 no longer
//!   mis-verifies the legacy tip cert (`cert bad sig`, 2026-10-06 08:56 stall).
//! - **v2.9.49:** pack uses a per-tx row undo (Pay/AssetPay) instead of a
//!   full draft clone per candidate (same root, ~20x more txs per budget;
//!   default cap 400 txs when `max_txs_per_ledger=0`). Catch-up asks any
//!   healthy non-jailed peer (hubs first, never self); a stale rival body at
//!   or below a certified tip no longer poisons catch-up. Status
//!   `recent_attestations` uses a cached O(n) newest-file scan (10 s TTL).
//!   No validity-rule change.
//! - **v2.9.50:** held (future) proposals never commit bare on catch-up
//!   cascade — only live soft-QC staging cascades `pending_ledgers`; catch-up
//!   advances solely via explicit certified batch items, and a catch-up body
//!   replaces any earlier live hold at the same height. Snapshot adopt clears
//!   leftover `stall` from an abandoned rival (v10 fork at ~372938, 2026-10-06).
//! - **v2.9.51:** ops liveness — (1) refuse to pack without a tip QC in
//!   `certs` (snapshot soft tip alone is not enough for `parent_cert`); a
//!   cert-less lottery winner self-skips after progress-timeout so VC/skip
//!   can elect a seat that can seal. (2) refuse to apply shared skip when
//!   any body is already open at the height (dual-proposal / equivocation
//!   after progress-timeout skip of a live sealer). (3) drop permanently
//!   failing applicable mempool heads (e.g. insufficient fee balance) in
//!   `sanitize_mempool` so unpayable txs are not counted as liveness work
//!   and cannot freeze the tip (watcher-browser seq stall at ~373270).
//! - **v2.9.52:** consume sticky equivocation evidence on commit. Pending
//!   slashes are dropped when `e.height <=` the committed ledger (not only
//!   when equal), so a dual queued at h=H then packed into H+1 (or later)
//!   cannot re-jail after Unjail. Also clear an offender's queued evidence
//!   when an Unjail tx commits. Fixes the live v1↔v12 ping-pong on h=373256
//!   (2026-10-06): drop_slashes kept one seat, the co-offender's evidence
//!   stayed queued, and Unjail of one re-armed the other.
//! - **v2.9.53:** disk hygiene (ops only; no consensus change). The hub
//!   disaster-recovery join serve dumped a fresh ~200 MB
//!   `/tmp/pl-hub-join-<id>-<tip>.json` per `NeedSnapshot` and never deleted
//!   it — 173 GB filled host2 and stalled the chain at 374384
//!   (2026-10-07). Hubs now reuse the periodic pinned serve file or one
//!   bounded `<data-dir>/<id>.hub-join.json` (deleted when idle); legacy
//!   dumps are removed at start. Low-disk guard ([`disk`]): optional dumps
//!   are skipped under the low-water mark (5% / 2 GB), the seat snapshot is
//!   refused only if it would leave < 256 MB, partial `.json.tmp` files are
//!   removed on write failure, loud `DISK LOW` logs, and status `disk`.
//!   Snapshot `.bak` copies are pruned to the newest 3 at start.
//! - **v2.9.54:** chained BTC header admission (mempool only; no change to
//!   block apply, verify, votes or the state root). `submit_tx` used to probe
//!   an incoming BTC `RailHeader` against the *committed* rail tip only, so
//!   with h+1 pending every h+2..h+32 of a submitter burst was rejected as
//!   `BTC header parent mismatch` (permanent) and the BTC rail advanced ~1
//!   header per block. The probe is now extended with the same account's
//!   pending txs at lower, contiguous sequences (cap
//!   [`Node::BTC_ADMIT_CHAIN_MAX`] = 64), replayed in packer order, so
//!   "accepted" still means "applicable after its predecessors". On any
//!   sequence gap, unappliable predecessor or deeper run, the check is the
//!   old committed-tip-only one. Out-of-order, gapped and forked headers are
//!   still rejected, and one account's pending headers never extend another's.
//! - **v2.9.56:** seal-tick CPU pin fix (local only; no change to block
//!   apply, verify, votes, wire or the state root; no activation height).
//!   A seat that caught up by batch could be the round-0 lottery winner for
//!   tip+1 while the mesh had already moved on. Each 200 ms tick then called
//!   `pack_or_skip`, whose `sanitize_mempool` dry-ran every mempool head on a
//!   full clone of state + bridge (~200 MB of never-pruned ETH exec headers)
//!   under `node.lock` before `may_pack_locally` refused with "tip lag". One
//!   tokio worker pinned, the logical clock slowed ~20x, the seat stopped
//!   gossiping and catch-up never applied (v10 h=376571 00:30 and v12
//!   h=377619 05:02 UTC, 2026-10-08; both needed a restart). Now:
//!   `pack_or_skip` checks `may_pack_locally` first; each head is dry-run at
//!   most once per tip (5 s logical TTL); `eth_exec_headers` is an `Arc`
//!   (copy-on-write) so bridge clones are a refcount bump. Serde output is
//!   byte-identical (`serde/rc`).
//! - **v2.9.57:** recert-split liveness fix (local only; no change to vote
//!   payloads, cert verification, apply or the state root; no activation).
//!   379780 stall (2026-10-08 07:36): 4 committee seats formed the round-0
//!   cert, 3 committed the tip via catch-up and re-OK'd it in the recert
//!   round. Cert holders never cast recert votes, so the recert round sat at
//!   3 < 4, the cert-less round-0 proposer looped "no tip cert", and the
//!   cert-less seats (by design) do not vote view-change: 3 VC voters < 4.
//!   Cert holders now answer a peer's recert vote for their tip with their
//!   own recert vote ([`Node::recert_assist`], re-sent every 3 s at most).
//! - **v2.9.58 "lean node":** local only — the state root, wire format, vote
//!   payloads and certs are byte-identical; no activation height.
//!   (a) The commitment root no longer re-encodes and re-hashes the ~199 MB
//!   ETH exec header map 3+ times per block: the map ([`exec_map`]) caches
//!   its canonical JSON per generation and a root already computed for
//!   identical bytes (verify → commit → status) is reused from a memo keyed
//!   on (sha256(prefix), map generation, sha256(suffix)). Snapshots reuse the
//!   cached JSON and are serialized + written outside `node.lock`.
//!   (b) Brief status serves the state root / LC claim root recorded at
//!   commit ([`Node::tip_roots`]) and skips claim-leaf / attestation work;
//!   full status computes those after the lock is dropped.
//!   (c) A lagging seat buffers correctly signed OKs for `tip+2..=tip+8`
//!   (bounded, [`Node::vote_ok_wire`]) instead of dropping them because
//!   `ok_vote_height` assumed `tip+1`; they are replayed when that height
//!   opens.
//! - **v2.9.59 "weak seat keeps up":** local only — state root, wire format,
//!   votes and certs byte-identical; no activation height.
//!   (1) Packer pacing ([`Node::pace_wait`], `--min-block-interval-ms`,
//!   default 2500; `--pace-mempool-txs`, default 128): the round-0 winner
//!   seals once the height has been open that long, or the mempool holds the
//!   threshold or a full block. Capped by [`Node::pace_effective_ms`] at one
//!   live pack window so pace + pack/seal/gossip stays inside peers' round-0
//!   silence timeout (2 windows); off after a skip / view-change. Receivers
//!   never check block spacing beyond `sealed_at >= parent` and `<= parent +
//!   60 s`. At 5 tx/s 2.9.58 sealed ~44 blocks/min of ~7 txs; pacing gives
//!   ~20/min of ~15.
//!   (2) The stage-time state root (one ~207 MB SHA-256 per block) is
//!   computed with `node.lock` released ([`Node::prestage_root_input`] builds
//!   the drafts under the lock; the hash fills the root memo; the stage
//!   then hits the memo). Pure warm-up: the stage verifies exactly as before.
//!   (3) SHA-256 via `ring` (runtime-detected SHA-NI / AVX2 / SSSE3 asm):
//!   identical digests; on the Skylake seat (no SHA-NI) 207 MB hashes in
//!   0.80 s vs 1.43 s with `sha2` (1.30 s with `sha2` asm).
//! - **v2.9.60:** ETH light client follows Sepolia **Gloas** (fork version
//!   `0x90000076`, epoch 353024, 2026-10-06 13:53:36 UTC). The LC froze at
//!   finalized slot 11296672 / period 1378 because Gloas LC headers carry only
//!   `execution_block_hash` (EIP-7732) and BeaconState gindices moved
//!   (EIP-7688). Consensus change gated by
//!   [`TESTNET_2300_ETH_LC_GLOAS_FROM_HEIGHT`] (TODO: placeholder `u64::MAX`
//!   until rollout): from that height `EthLcUpdate`/`EthLcBootstrap` verify
//!   both header formats with per-slot gindices and the spec signature fork
//!   slot, and the hash-only LC head takes its number/receipts root from the
//!   stored RLP-verified execution header with that hash. Below it, apply is
//!   byte-for-byte 2.9.59.
//!   Same gate, rolling exec-header prune ([`bridge::ETH_EXEC_HEADER_WINDOW`]
//!   = 50_400, about 7 days): `BridgeState::eth_exec_prune_floor` is
//!   `max(old, lc.execution_number.saturating_sub(window))` when the LC head
//!   number is resolved (`execution_number != 0`). The floor is monotonic, so
//!   a static LC head never deletes another header, and it is part of the
//!   state root once non-zero (serde skips zero, so pre-activation bytes
//!   match 2.9.59). The cut runs at the start of the pack, verify and commit
//!   drafts for that height (one-off when the gate is crossed, then every
//!   later block) and again after a gated bootstrap, update or
//!   `EthExecHeaders` resolves the head. `mint_evm_lc` below the floor
//!   returns `deposit older than header window` (permanent). Status exposes
//!   top-level `eth_exec_prune_floor` and `eth_exec_window`.
//! - **v2.9.61:** V3 peg-in is mint-or-refund, gated by
//!   [`TESTNET_2300_ETH_V3_FROM_HEIGHT`] (independent of the Gloas height;
//!   placeholder `u64::MAX`). `TxBody::EthV3Deposit` is permissionless. Inside
//!   3 days of LC-head time a deposit credits the FPL account whose id hashes
//!   to `dest20`, or refunds the sender when that preimage is not a creditable
//!   name. After 3 days (still inside the 7-day header window) it refunds the
//!   sender. A refund appends an `evm-wd-v1` leaf (`sha256("refund|" ||
//!   depositId)`); a mint writes no claim leaf. Each deposit id resolves once.
//!   The first activated ledger with a resolved LC head number sets
//!   `eth_v1_deposit_cutoff`; a later V1/V2/DestLock mint above that number
//!   is rejected. `fundPool` (`PoolFunded`, no Deposit log) mints nothing.
//!   Pre-activation the new state fields are omitted, so commitment bytes
//!   match 2.9.60. While `!eth_v3_at(tip + 1)` an `EthV3Deposit` is refused
//!   at mempool entry and dropped from peer batches / exports, so it is never
//!   kept or relayed (#34; admission only). See `docs/ETH_V3_DEPOSITS.md`.
//! - **v2.10.0** (`consensus_rounds`, activation `vote_rounds_from_height`):
//!   OK votes are scoped to **(height, round)** (`pl-ok:v2`); only two hashes
//!   in one round are equivocation (evidence kept + signature-checked). One
//!   proposer per round (`order[round % n]`, cursor derived from the round).
//!   Work-gated round timeouts with backoff; proven split ⇒ immediate round.
//!   Typed `ConsensusStall` replaces substring checks. Liveness watchdog
//!   alerts only when work exists on a flat tip (h=369421 halt, 2026-09-28).
//!   Pre-activation: typed dual drives VC even with a pending; idle VC off.
//! - If #1 is silent for `progress_timeout_ms`, **quorum** `SkipPacker` votes → #2 packs
//! - Stuck pending / dual proposals → **view-change soft QC** (height-local, not genesis wipe)
//! - Tip advances only after **soft QC**; hard QC capped by |ONLINE|
//! - Equivocation → jail/slash; uncommitted dual proposals use **QC-first** choice
//! - Empty ledgers rejected
//!
//! See `docs/IDENTITY.md` and `docs/POC.md`.
